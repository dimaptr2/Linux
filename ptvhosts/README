How we can do the PC Stick for TV Panel with Debian Linux and with the autostarting Chrome browser without desktop.

First of all, we must install Debian Linux in the PC stick with LXDE desktop environment. Second, you must replace the configuration files.

Put next files:
1. 10-monitor.conf into /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d
2. cleanstartchrome.sh into ~/bin
3. lightdm.conf into /etc/lightdm
4. autostart into ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE
5. Install the program that can hide the mouse cursor:
	sudo apt-get -y install unclutter
	unclutter -idle 0.01 -root
6. And set the settings from the file crontab.txt in the "crontab -e" command. Set the rule:
@reboot bin/./cleanstartchrome.sh
7. Copy wpa_supplicant.conf file into ptvadm@ptv2:/home/ptvadm and transfer it into /etc/wpa_supplicant and trasfer it after into /etc/wpa_supplicant/.
8. Copy script into scanwiwi.py into /usr/local/bin as root user. Create crontab task that is executing the task /usr/local/bin/scanwifi.py 
9. Copy the script ping.sh into directory /scripts and set the crontab rules: 
* * * * * /scripts/ping.sh
* * * * * (sleep 30;/scripts/ping.sh)
